dotfiles
========

My collection of dotfiles used across my computers. Repository structure inspired by [Jamie Wong's dotfiles](https://github.com/phleet/dotfiles/).

Feel free to reuse any tidbits in your own configuration.

Usage
-----

- Install git, GNU Make, and a C compiler (for matcher)
- Clone the repository (after optionally forking it)
    - If on a server, use `git clone -b servers` to prevent getting unnecessary files
- `cd dotfiles` and `make`
- In vim: `:BundleInstall`
