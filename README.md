dotfiles
========

My collection of unix dotfiles used across my computers.
Repository structure inspired by [Jamie Wong's dotfiles](https://github.com/phleet/dotfiles/).
Feel free to reuse any tidbits in your own configuration!


Usage
-----

- Install git, vim, GNU Make, and a C compiler (for matcher)
- Clone the repository
- `cd dotfiles` and `make` (this will automatically fetch submodules and install vim bundles)
